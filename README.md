## üìã Typical Tasks
- **Deploying development environments** in K8s on AWS with Docker Images in GitHub and automatic deployment via ArgoCD.
- **Setting up and maintaining RabbitMQ clusters** for development.
- **Designing and developing backends** using microservice architecture.
- **Writing code** using the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach.
- **Preparing, running, and analyzing Fuzz tests** with OWASP Zap.
- **Creating and maintaining CI/CD pipelines** for automated testing and deployment.
- **Working with Terraform** to manage cloud resources across various platforms.
- **Design and implement WebSocket communication** for real-time applications.

## üå± Outside of Work
- Building a local infrastructure for personal projects using VirtualBox and K8s. The value of this skill lies in the ability to deploy each element of the system in High Availability (HA) mode. This means I can shut down a MySQL or RabbitMQ node, and everything should continue to function without issues.
- Exploring various frameworks ‚Äî even at the "just play around" level ‚Äî to stay informed about what's available on the market and how it can be used effectively.
- Researching technologies such as Google reCAPTCHA, MySQL Cluster NDB, and RabbitMQ in RPC mode to understand their inner workings and best use cases and many others.
- Reading books on software architecture, design patterns, and best practices to improve my skills and knowledge.
- Learning machine learning and data science to understand how to apply these technologies in real-world scenarios.

## üí° What I Love
I love new challenges and working on startups. I enjoy the freedom to choose technologies and applying modern approaches to solving problems.

## üåê Where I Work
I am currently working at [Cloud Solutions](https://cloud-solutions.io) ‚Äî a startup in the development phase.
